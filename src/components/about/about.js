    <p>My name is Charles Kim. I have been working as an 8th grade math teacher for the past decade, but I have always been interested in computer programming and developing my own apps. In late 2022, I embarked on learning more about the world of developing by taking a Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp at Northwestern. Six months later, I have a certificate and can say I am very excited to start my professional journey into the world of developing.</p>
